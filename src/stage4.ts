// Stage 4: Scheduled Transfers
// Overview:
// This stage extends the transfer system with support for scheduling a transfer to be created at a future time.
//
// A scheduled transfer is a plan to initiate a normal transfer (as defined in Stage 3) at a specific future time.
// The transfer does not exist or affect balances until the scheduled time is reached and the system is explicitly told to process it.
//
// This simulates real-world automation, payroll, or recurring payment use cases.
//
// Requirements:
// - When a scheduled transfer is created, it is stored as a pending job.
// - At or after the `scheduledFor` time, it must be processed manually via `processScheduledTransfers(...)`.
// - Processing the transfer behaves like `createTransfer(...)` (Stage 3), including withdrawal, TTL, and transfer ID assignment.
// - Scheduled transfers that fail to process (e.g., sender has insufficient funds) are discarded silently.
// - Each scheduled transfer must be uniquely identifiable by an ID string.
// - Scheduled transfers are not counted toward history or transaction volume unless they successfully become accepted transfers.
//
// Notes:
// - Processing scheduled transfers should be idempotent: if a transfer is already processed, it should not repeat or error.
// - The system does not auto-run anything â€” processing is explicitly triggered.
