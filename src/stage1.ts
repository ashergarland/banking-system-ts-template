// Stage 1: Basic Account Management
// Overview:
// In this stage, you will implement core account operations for a banking system,
// including account creation, deposits, withdrawals, and balance inquiries.
// This stage focuses on correct state management, input validation, and failure handling.

// Requirements:
// - Each account has a unique string ID and a non-negative integer balance (starting at 0).
// - Deposits and withdrawals require a Unix timestamp (milliseconds since epoch).
// - Deposit and withdrawal amounts must be strictly positive integers.
// - Withdrawals must fail if the account lacks sufficient funds.
